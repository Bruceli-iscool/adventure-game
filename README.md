# Adventure-Game
A dungeon crawler/adventure game written in java 

# Building the Game
Make sure you have Gradle and Java 21 or above installed.
Clone the repo and run `gradle build` in the project directory.
Go and find the zip or tar in the `app/build/distributions`.
Unzip and run. (Or you can use some pre-built binarys that I build occasionally.)
